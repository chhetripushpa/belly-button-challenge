# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
In this assignment, weccreated an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the diverse microbes that inhabit human navels. The dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), are found in over 70% of individuals, while the remaining species are relatively rare. This project aims to visualize and analyze the distribution of these microbial species, providing insights into human microbiome diversity. Please check the static deployed page to have look into visuals of bar and bubble chart and explore the interactive dashborad created.
